To reproduce this code:
1. `git clone https://github.com/TheJoWo/Clean-Clode`
2. Feed this prompt to an LLM in that directory

---

> In this directory I've placed a project, `Clean-Clode`. Clean-Clode simply removes all this formatting junk. Rewrite Clean-Clode into a CLI util in Rust, called `clean`. Using `clean` would be simply `cat dirty.txt | clean`. Users then will likely create an alias in their shell that does something like `cat <arg[0]> | clean | pbcopy` to get it on their clipboard.

Execute this task with clean minimal and idiomatic rust code.
